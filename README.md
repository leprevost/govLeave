# govLeave
A government managed platform to mediate the negotiation of sick leave between employers and employees in a fair and transparent manner. This platform will act as a 3rd party which sits between the employer and employee. An employee will initiate sick leave through this platform, which will in turn inform the employer of the request. Both parties will be informed of their rights and responsibilities regarding sick leave specific to the nature of their working relationship.
 
Parties have the option of negotiating sick leave, and escalating issues to relevant government bodies (eg. fair work australia). This app hopes to promote employees utilising their available sick leave (to prevent the spread of disease), and also to protect employers from unfair demands.
 
Data Story

 
This app will provide a messaging platform between employers and employees, and also present information (health statistics and financial data) relevant to the negotiation of sick leave. AI will track the utilisation of sick leave, and help identify unfair actions by either party.
 
While health statistics will attempt to inform sick employees of the risks they pose to others or, on the other hand, the consequences of taking unnecessary sick leave.
